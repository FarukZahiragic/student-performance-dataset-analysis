Data analysis of a dataset that contains student information. 
The dataset is used to test hypothesis related to student performance and it's correlation with various parameters. 
This project is a collaboration with three of my fellow university colleagues. 
We analyzed the data using Python and ,among others, the Pandas and NumPy Python libraries.
